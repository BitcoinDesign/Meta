# Bitcoin Design - Meta
`community`, `project-management`, `process`

Activity in the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/) largely happens in the Slack workspace and here on Github, but also in the various projects our members are involved in (see some of them [here](https://bitcoin.design/projects/)).

Community activity is fluid, see the [contribute page](https://bitcoin.design/contribute/) on the website for all the important starting points and links, and also join the [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-10sxfovaq-isViijl4RThKRs_TsAQnuA).

This repository is used for organizing calls, group consensus and coordination. The [Guide](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide) repository is for the [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://bitcoin.design/guide/) we are working on, which is a design reference for anyone building open-source bitcoin products.
