# Community calls

Community calls are a great way for us to come together, make introductions, talk about projects, and chat about what's on our collective minds. 

After having organized a few calls, we established several practices outlined here in Q&A form.

**How often are calls?**

We have them every third Wednesday. The easiest way to stay up-to-date is via our [calendar](README.md#the-bitcoin-design-calendar). During in-between weeks, we host Design Review and Design Guide Jam Session calls.

Calls are officially 1 hour, but many times go over by 15-30 minutes for those who want. There is also an open pre-call on Jitsi for casual conversation that startes 1 hour earlier.

**What time of day are calls?**

They are at 9am PT. For the first 6-7 calls, we voted on the time. Since the result was always the same, we standardized it. However, we can adjust if this doesn't work for many.

**What format do the calls have?**

We have used various formats, from structured presentations to wide open discussion. All have been interesting, so we are picking each call format based on what is appropriate at the moment.

Some examples:

- Update on what happened since the last call
- Focus on important community topics like governance
- Project show and tell
- Introductions
- Coffee chat (open discussion)
- Allow anyone to suggest topics for discussion

**How are calls announced?**

- An issue is created 1-2 months earlier
- They appear on the [calendar](README.md#the-bitcoin-design-calendar)
- Two @channel message are sent out on Slack, the first one 1 week ahead, and the second one 1 day ahead of the call
- A regular Slack in the #general channel is sent out shortly before the call

**What tools do we use?**

- We currently use password-protected Zoom calls
- Google Meet is lacking the moderation options we want
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) does not scale to the group size we want
- BigBlueButton has been proposed, but we have not tested it

**Are calls recorded?**

We have not recorded them so far. There has been interest in recordings, but there is also a sense that the privacy of individuals should be respected. This can make participants more comfortable and result in conversations we might otherwise not have.

We may start recording portions of calls, or whole calls, but never without permission and clearly asking participants for their consent. The benefits is that recordings provide more transparency to the wider community.

**Are calls transcribed?**

Short, concise summaries are posted in the call issues. Personally identifiable information is removed. The types of notes taken differs based on the call format.

**What else?**

- Calls should not be used to make decisions as that would exclude too many people, and group dynamics might affect the result
- Real or fake names are fine
- Lurking is fine although participation is encouraged

**Who organizes calls**

This is currently handled by [Christoph](https://github.com/gbks).
